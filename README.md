## About
And this is a fork of Mai-Lapyst's Fork. Let's see if I can add to that.

(This is a fork & continuation of owmii's great "Lost Trinkets" mod, which only ever got updated to 1.16.5, and only ever ran on forge. With this mod, I try to re-aweaken the mod a little bit by not only updateing it to newer minecraft versions, but also by providing a fabric version.)

Fork of 1.17 mod:
